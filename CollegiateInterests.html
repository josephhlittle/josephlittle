<p> I have yet to decide where exactly I would like to further my education, however, I have been granted admission into Murray State and The University of Mississippi. Other than those two colleges I have applied to The University of Chattanooga, Mississippi State University, Arkansas State University, University of Tennesse at Knoxville, and Memphis University. I am undecided on what exactly my major of study would be however I have a few ideas. Some interests of mine have been the majors of either History, English, Business, or Physical Science/Sports Managment. Depending on the college that I decide upon, I am planning on participating in the ROTC program and possibly having a military career. I am looking forward to seeing what is in store for the next chapter of my life, and seeing where I am led to continue.
