<p> I have enjoyed many sports since my earliest memories. I enjoy almost all forms of athletic competition and it has molded me into the person I am today. I could not imagine a life without athletics, in particular baseball. I started playing baseball when I was six years old and it hasn't left my side since. I now am getting ready for my senior season at Madison Academic, my last season as a Mustang. Baseball is not the only sport I've participated in during my adolescence, and it also it not the only extra-ciricular activity that I have participated in. I have also been a member of Fellowship Christian Atheletes all four years of high school, and a member of the P.E. Club from sophomore year to senior year.

<p> Throughout my life sports has taught me many life lessons. Of those lessons it has taught me discipline, perservence, and that to succeed you must work for it. Baseball is my favorite sport becuase it is a team sport, I love to compete and win as a team. I enjoy other sports too such as football, basketball, fishing, and in general most every form of competition.</p>
