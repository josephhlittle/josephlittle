  <p>My name is Joseph Little. I live in Jackson, Tennesse, and go to Madison Academic High School. I am 17 years old, and a senior. I play baseball for Madison and participate in several club activities too. I enjoy having a great time and spending my time with my family and friends, and building those bonds. I am also looking forward to college. I'm not sure where I will go yet but I have several colleges in mind, and what I would like to do when I get there.</p>
