<p>Phishing: Sending e-mails to companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information.
Flaming: is a hostile way of insulting another person over the internet.
Spamming: Sending the same message to multiple people or large recipients over the internet.
All of the above definitions are similar in the fact that they all have to do with being in the online world.
Phishing and Spamming both have to do with trying to get something out of the recipient whether it is to purchase some of their merchandise or to expose personal information of a certain person.
Flaming and Phishing both want to expose to the recipient and bad things for them, however spamming usually just wants the recipient to buy some sort of merchandise or selling something usually.
