<p> I have enjoyed many sports since my earliest memories. I enjoy almost all forms of athletic competition and it has molded me into the person I am today. I could not imagine a life without athletics, in particular baseball. I started playing baseball when I was six years old and it hasn't left my side since. I now am getting ready for my senior season at Madison Academic, my last season as a Mustang. Baseball is not the only sport I've participated in during my adolescence, and it also it not the only extra-ciricular activity that I have participated in. I have also been a member of Fellowship Christian Atheletes all four years of high school, and a member of the P.E. Club from sophomore year to senior year.
